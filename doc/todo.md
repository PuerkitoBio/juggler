# juggler

TODO :
* document root juggler package (godoc)
* make client thread-safe (seems to already be the case? double-check, add concurrent test and run with -race).
* better test coverage
* README/License and blog article
* run something like https://github.com/mkevac/debugcharts and https://github.com/uber/go-torch and possibly https://github.com/davecheney/gcvis

TODO :
* Callee exposing a func with no argument: will json.Marshal complain about an empty json.RawMessage?
* Client: build a callback-style func-to-result mapping?
* run something like https://github.com/rakyll/gom, https://github.com/mkevac/debugcharts and https://github.com/uber/go-torch and possibly https://github.com/davecheney/gcvis
